This directory structure contains the source code for the current
forth200x basis document.

Requirements
============

I assume you have a standard latex2e system installed. This includes
the use of the latex, pdflatex, and dvips programs.  I also assume
a perl interpreter is installed.

The document uses a number of standard latex packages.  These are
part of the standard latex2e installation.  If your system does not
have any of these packages they can be obtained from your local
CTAN mirror (www.ctan.org).

a4wide:		Setting the paper size correctly
fancyhdr:	fancy headings
changebar:	change bars
ulem:		underline and struck thorough text
hyperref:	hyper references
helvet:		Helvetica font, part of PS-NFSS
courier:	Courier font, also part of PS-NFSS

In addition to these packages I also make use of the following
optional packages:

answers:	Deferred text - this is provided as a .sty, but the
		full package is provided in the Support directory.
		It is also available on CTAN.

history:	Change Log - I have been developing this package
		alongside the document.  The version included here
		is the full code as it currently exists.


Building the Document
=====================

I have include both a makefile for use with *nix systems and a
make.bat for use with dos/windows systems.  Simply cd into the
directory and type make.

There are a number of make targets available:

dvi:	This will build a "forth.dvi" file.  I use it for testing
	the document.  It is also used to produce the PostScript
	version of the document.

ps:	This will produce a file "forth.ps", a PostScript version
	of the document.  It uses both latex and dvips to do this.

pdf:	This will produce a file "forth.pdf", a PDF version of
	the document, complete with internal hyper links.
	pdflatex is used to produce this.

clean:	Will clean up all the temporary files which get left behind.

html:	This will produce a file "forth.html" and a number of
	supporting files.  This is still rather experimental and
	is not currently supported in the document.  It uses the
	tex4ht package to convert the file, but I provide no
	configuration for the package.


The latex process
=================

The main "driver" file is "forth.tex".  This will include all the
other files as it needs them.  In order to build the final document
you need to run it though latex several times.

Define Labels
-------------
The first time it runs, it will generate a lot of auxiliary files,
these contain information needed for the cross referencing system.
The first time you run latex it will generate a set of "labels" and
you will see a large number of warnings of the form:

	LaTeX Warning: Reference `search:ONLY' on page 274 undefined
	on input line 398.

and

	LaTeX Warning: Can't find definition of "TIB" in wordlist
	"core", reference on page 2 on input line 128.

These are produced because the labels have not been defined yet, they
are being defined by this run.

Sort the index
--------------
When latex is run on forth.tex it produces a "forth.wrd" file.  This
is the list of words defined in the document given in the order they
have been defined.  In order to get the alphabetical word list used
as the index we have to sort this list.  This is done with the aid
of a small perl script which produces a "forth.wds" file.

As this file uses labels to locate the page of a word definition, we
do not need to wait for the page numbers to settle down.

Getting the labels correct
--------------------------

As there are no labels on the first run, place holders are used.
These will not be the same size as the text of the actual label.
Thus having defined the labels, we have to run the file though latex
once again to get the labels correct.

As the table of contents and the labels are left over from the last
run, it is necessary to run the file through for a third time to
resolve all the page numbers correctly.

Change Bars
-----------
It may be necessary to run the file though latex one last time, so
that the change bars are correctly aligned.  This uses a similar
technique to the labels, in that it collects the information it
requires on one run, and then uses that information on a second run.
Unfortunately, the information may change on the third run, in which
case a final run to align the chage bars is required.

NOTE: The make scripts DO NOT perform this final run as it is only
      necessary on occasion.


Utilities
=========

I have been developing the document on a Windows/XP system using the
following public domain utilities:

MiKTeX 2.5	www.miktex.org
LEd 0.51	www.latexEditor.org
TextPad 5.0	www.textpad.com
Perl 5.8	www.ActiveState.com/perl
