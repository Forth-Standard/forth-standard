	After \word{KEYq} returns with a value of \emph{true},

		The Technical Committee has gone around several times on the

		with type-ahead on some systems, while requiring the
		implementation of a single-character buffer on machines where
		polling the keyboard inevitably results in the destruction of
		the character.

		Use of \word[core]{KEY} or \word{KEYq} indicates that the
		application does not wish to bother with non-character events,
		so they are discarded, in anticipation of eventually receiving
		a valid character. Applications wishing to handle non-character
		events must use \word{EKEY} and \word{EKEYq}. It is possible
		to mix uses of \word{KEYq}/\word[core]{KEY} and
		\word{EKEYq}/\word{EKEY} within a single application, but
		the application must use \word{KEYq} and \word[core]{KEY} only

\item \stack{}{u}

	\wref{core:KEY}{KEY}.

	\begin{defer}
	\rationale % A.10.6.2.1305 EKEY
		\word{EKEY} provides a standard word to access a system-dependent
		set of ``raw'' keyboard events, including events corresponding
		to members of the standard character set, events corresponding
		to other members of the implementation-defined character set,
		and keystrokes that do not correspond to members of the
		character set.

		\word{EKEY} assumes no particular numerical correspondence
		between particular event code values and the values representing
		standard characters. On some systems, this may allow two
		separate keys that correspond to the same standard character
		to be distinguished from one another.

		In systems that combine both keyboard and mouse events into a
		single ``event stream'', the single number returned by
		\word{EKEY} may be inadequate to represent the full range of
		input possibilities. In such systems, a single ``event record''
		may include a time stamp, the x,y coordinates of the mouse
		position, the keyboard state, and the state of the mouse
		buttons. In such systems, it might be appropriate for \word{EKEY}
		to return the address of an ``event record'' from which the
		other information could be extracted.

		\place{X:ekeys}{While the standard specifies a timing
		relationship between EKEY?, KEY?, EKEY and KEY, one
		way to avoid any potential problems in this respect is
		as follows: If you use EKEY at all, use only EKEY and
		EKEY?; when you want a character and nothing else,
		drop all EKEY results that are not characters (as
		recognized by EKEY>CHAR).}

		Also, consider a hypothetical Forth system running under
		MS-DOS on a PC-compatible computer. Assume that the
		implementation-defined character set is the ``normal'' 8-bit
		PC character set. In that character set, the codes from 0 to
		127 correspond to ASCII characters. The codes from 128 to 255
		represent characters from various non-English languages,
		mathematical symbols, and some graphical symbols used for line
		drawing. In addition to those characters, the keyboard can
		generate various other ``scan codes'', representing such
		non-character events as arrow keys and function keys.

		There may be multiple keys, with different scan codes,
		corresponding to the same standard character. For example,
		the character representing the number ``1'' often appears both
		in the row of number keys above the alphabetic keys, and also
		in the separate numeric keypad.

		When a program asks the MS-DOS operating system for a keyboard
		event, it receives either a single non-zero byte, representing
		a character, or a zero byte followed by a ``scan code'' byte,
		representing a non-character keyboard event (e.g., a function
		key).

		\word{EKEY} represents each keyboard event as a single number,
		rather than as a sequence of numbers. For the system described
		above, the following would be a reasonable implementation of
		\word{EKEY} and related words:

		\begin{quote}
			The \texttt{MAX-CHAR} environmental query would return 255.

			(Interrupt 21h, Function 0Bh).

		\end{quote}

		\setwordlist{facility}
		This is a full-featured implementation, providing the
		application program with an easy way to either handle
		non-character events (with \word{EKEY}), or to ignore them
		and to only consider ``real'' characters (with
		\word[core]{KEY}).

		Note that \word{EKEY} maps scan codes from 0 to 255 into
		numbers from 256 to 511. \word{EKEY} maps the number 259,
		representing the keyboard combination Ctrl-Shift-@, to the
		character whose numerical value is 0 (ASCII NUL). Many ASCII
		keyboards generate ASCII NUL for Ctrl-Shift-@, so we use that
		key combination for ASCII NUL (which is otherwise unavailable
		from MS-DOS, because the zero byte signifies that another
		scan-code byte follows).

		One consequence of using the ``Direct STDIN Input'' system call
		(function 7) instead of the ``STDIN Input'' system call
		(function 8) is that the normal DOS ``Ctrl-C interrupt'' behavior
		is disabled when the system is waiting for input (Ctrl-C would
		still cause an interrupt while characters are being output). On
		the other hand, if the ``STDIN Input'' system call (function 8)
		were used to implement \word{EKEY}, Ctrl-C interrupts would be
		enabled, but Ctrl-Shift-@ would also cause an interrupt, because
		the operating system would treat the second byte of the 0,3
		sequence as a Ctrl-C, even though the 3 is really a scan code
		and not a character. One ``best of both worlds'' solution is to
		use function 8 for the first byte received by \word{EKEY}, and
		function 7 for the scan code byte. For example:

		\begin{quote}
			\setwordlist{core}\ttfamily
			\begin{tabbing}
			\tab \= \tab \= \tab \= \tab \= \hspace{7em} \= \kill
			\+ \word{:} \word[facility]{EKEY}~ \word{p} -- u ) \\
				\+ DOS-KEY-FUNCTION-8~ \word{qDUP}~ \word{0=}~ \word{IF} \\
					DOS-KEY-FUNCTION-7~ \word{DUP} 3~ \word{=}~ \word{IF} \\
					\> \word{DROP} 0~ \word{ELSE}~ 256 \word{+}\\
				\- \word{THEN} \\
			\- \word{THEN} \\
			\word{;}
			\end{tabbing}
		\end{quote}
		\setwordlist{facility}

		Of course, if the Forth implementor chooses to pass Ctrl-C
		through to the program, without using it for its usual
		interrupt function, then DOS function 7 is appropriate in both
		cases (and some additional care must be taken to prevent a
		typed-ahead Ctrl-C from interrupting the Forth system during
		output operations).

		A Forth system might also choose a simpler implementation of
		\word[core]{KEY}, without implementing \word{EKEY}, as follows:

		\setwordlist{core}
		\begin{quote}\ttfamily
			\word{:} \word{KEY}~~ \word{p} -- char )~
				DOS-KEY~
			\word{;}

			\word{:} \word[facility]{KEYq}~ \word{p} -- flag )~
				DOS-KEY?~ \word{0ne}~
			\word{;}
		\end{quote}
		\setwordlist{facility}

		The disadvantages of the simpler version are:

		\begin{enumerate}
		\item An application program that uses \word[core]{KEY},
			expecting to receive only valid characters, might receive a
			sequence of bytes (e.g., a zero byte followed by a byte with
			the same numerical value as the letter ``A'' that appears to
			contain a valid character, even though the user pressed a key
			(e.g., function key 4) that does not correspond to any valid
			character.

		\item An application program that wishes to handle non-character
			events will have to execute \word[core]{KEY} twice if it
			returns zero the first time. This might appear to be a
			reasonable and easy thing to do. However, such code is not
			portable to other systems that do not use a zero byte as an
			``escape'' code. Using the \word{EKEY} approach, the
			algorithm for handling keyboard events can be the same for
			all systems; the system dependencies can be reduced to a
			table or set of constants listing the system-dependent key
			codes used to access particular application functions.
			Without \word{EKEY}, the algorithm, not just the table, is
			likely to be system dependent.
		\end{enumerate}

		Another approach to \word{EKEY} on MS-DOS is to use the BIOS
		``Read Keyboard Status'' function (Interrupt 16h, Function 01h)
		or the related ``Check Keyboard'' function (Interrupt 16h,
		Function 11h). The advantage of this function is that it allows
		the program to distinguish between different keys that correspond
		to the same character (e.g. the two ``1'' keys). The disadvantage
		is that the BIOS keyboard functions read only the keyboard. They
		cannot be ``redirected'' to another ``standard input'' source,
		as can the DOS STDIN Input functions.

	\begin{defer}
	\rationale
		This words has been provided to allow for systems which may not
		be able to interpret the value returned from \word{EKEY}
		directly. A simple implementation for a system which is capable
		of interpreting the value returned from \word{EKEY} would be:

		\begin{quote}
			\ttfamily
			\word{:} \word{EKEYtoFKEY} \word{p} u1 -{}- u2 flag ) \\
			\tab \word{DUP} \word{EKEYtoCHAR} \word{NIP} \word{0=} \word{;}
		\end{quote}

		The value returned from \word{EKEYtoFKEY} can be interpreted
		via a set of pre-defined constants and masks. This provides
		the application programmer with the ability to process the
		non-ASCII keys in a standard way. Note however, that not all
		keyboards provide these keys. Indeed, some devices will not
		have a keyboard. A standard program should be written in such
		a way that they will continue to work without these additional
		keys. Albeit with a limited or reduced functionality.

		The \texttt{K-}{\ldots} words produce the same values that the
		sequence \word{EKEY} \word{EKEYtoFKEY} may produce when the
		user presses the corresponding keys. Note that some systems
		may lack some of the keys, or the system the capability to
		report them. Programs should be written such that they continue
		to work (although less conveniently or with less functionality)
		if these key combinations cannot be produced.

		Typical Use:

		\begin{quote}
			{\ldots} \word{EKEY} \word{EKEYtoFKEY} \word{IF} \\
			\tab \word{CASE} \\
			\tab[2] \word{K-UP} \word{OF} {\ldots} \word{ENDOF} \\
			\tab[2] \word{K-F1} \word{OF} {\ldots} \word{ENDOF} \\
			\tab[2] \word{K-LEFT} \word{K-SHIFT-MASK} \word{OR}
			                      \word{K-CTRL-MASK} \word{OR}
			                    \word{OF} {\ldots} \word{ENDOF} \\
			\tab[2] {\ldots} \\
			\tab \word{ENDCASE} \\
			\word{ELSE} \\
			\tab {\ldots} \\
			\word{THEN}
		\end{quote}

	\item[\word{EKEY} return values] ~\\
		The intention behind \word{EKEY} was that it would return the
		implementation defined keyboard scan code. The implementation
		defined nature of the value means that a standard program may
		not use the value in any way, other than passing it on to
		\word{EKEYtoCHAR} to convert it into an ASCII character.

		\word{EKEYtoFKEY} has been designed to be used in a similar
		manner. It provides an implementation defined value which
		corresponds to non-ASCII keys, or a combination thereof. A
		standard program may check which key combination has been used
		via a set of pre-defined constants.

%		There was a discussion about what the standard says about
%		EKEY return values. In particular, the non-specification
%		of a lifetime for the return value has been interpreted as
%		meaning that it has unlimited lifetime and thus an
%		implementation where the return value is an address of an
%		overwritable buffer is non-standard; whereas others believes
%		that the implementation-defined nature of the result would make
%		such an EKEY implementation standard. However, no such
%		implementation of EKEY is known, and a clarification of
%		that aspect is desirable. However, with the introduction of
%		EKEY>FKEY the proposal could even be implemented on a
%		system with such an EKEY implementation, so the place
%		for the clarification is probably not in this proposal
%		(unless we take EKEY>FKEY out again).

%		Programming advice

	\item[Shift keys] ~\\
		Note that, as defined, the shift key masks
		(\wref{facility:K-SHIFT-MASK}{K-SHIFT-MASK},
		 \wref{facility:K-CTRL-MASK}{K-CTRL-MASK} and
		 \wref{facility:K-ALT-MASK}{K-ALT-MASK})
		are only useful for recognising shifted cursor and function
		keys, because these are the only values defined for use with
		\word{EKEYtoFKEY}.
		E.g., a standard program cannot recognise \textsc{Alt-T},
		because no \word{EKEY} return value for \texttt{T} has been
		defined.

	\implementation \rmfamily
		The implementation is closely tied to the implementation of
		\word{EKEY} and therefore unportable.
