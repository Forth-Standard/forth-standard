Forth is a language for direct communication between human beings and
machines. Forth was invented by Charles Moore to increase programmer
productivity without sacrificing machine efficiency.
Using natural-language diction and machine-oriented syntax,
Forth provides an economical, productive environment for interactive
compilation and execution of programs. Forth also provides low-level
access to computer-controlled hardware, and the ability to extend the
language itself. This extensibility allows the language to be quickly
expanded and adapted to special needs and different hardware systems.
Forth provides for highly interactive program development and testing.

In the interests of transportability of application software written in
Forth, standardization efforts began in the mid-1970s by an international
group of users and implementors who adopted the name ``Forth Standards Team''.
This effort resulted in the Forth-77 Standard. As the language continued
to evolve, an interim Forth-78 Standard was published by the Forth Standards
Team. Following Forth Standards Team meetings in 1979, the Forth-79 Standard
was published in 1980. Major changes were made by the Forth Standards Team
in the Forth-83 Standard, which was published in 1983.

The first meeting of the Technical Committee on Forth Programming Systems
was convened by the Organizing Committee of the X3J14 Forth Technical
Committee on August 3, 1987, and has met subsequently on
November 11--12, 1987,
