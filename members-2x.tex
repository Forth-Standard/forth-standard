This document is maintained by the Forth 200\emph{x} Standards
Committee. The committee meetings are open to the public, anybody
is allowed to join the committee in its deliberations. Currently
the committee has the following voting members:

Membership of the committee is open to anybody who can attend.  On
attending a meeting of any kind a non-member becomes an observing
member (observer).  If they attend the next voting meeting, they
will become a voting member of the committee, otherwise they revert
to non-member status.  An observer will not normally be allowed to
vote, but may be allowed at the discretion of the committee.  A
member will be deemed to have resigned from the committee if they
fail to attend two consecutive voting meetings.
