\section{Additional terms} % 7.2

\begin{description}
\item[block:]
	1024 characters of data on mass storage,
	designated by a block number.

\item[block buffer:]
	A block-sized region of data space where a block is made
	temporarily available for use. The current block buffer
	is the block buffer most recently accessed by
	\word{BLOCK}, \word{BUFFER}, \word{LOAD}, \word{LIST}, or
	\word{THRU}.
\end{description}

Append table \ref{block:env} to table \ref{table:env}.

See: \xref[3.2.6 Environmental queries]{usage:env}.

\begin{table}[h]

\end{table}

\subsection{Data space} % 7.3.2

A program may access memory within a valid block buffer.

See: \xref[3.3.3 Data Space]{usage:dataspace}.

\subsection{Block buffer regions} % 7.3.3
\label{block:buffers}

The address of a block buffer returned by \word{BLOCK} or
\word{BUFFER} is transient. A call to \word{BLOCK} or \word{BUFFER}
may render a previously-obtained block-buffer address invalid, as
may a call to any word that:
\begin{itemize}
\item parses:
\item displays characters on the user output device, such as
	\word[core]{TYPE} or \word[core]{EMIT};
\item controls the user output device, such as \word[core]{CR} or
	\word[facility]{AT-XY};
\item receives or tests for the presence of characters from the
	user input device such as \word[core]{ACCEPT} or
	\word[core]{KEY};
\item waits for a condition or event, such as \word[facility]{MS}
	or \word[facility]{EKEY};
\item manages the block buffers, such as \word{FLUSH},
	\word{SAVE-BUFFERS}, or \word{EMPTY-BUFFERS};
\item performs any operation on a file or file-name directory
	that implies I/O, such as \word{REFILL} or any word that
	returns an \emph{ior};
\item implicitly performs I/O, such as text interpreter nesting
	and un-nesting when files are being used (including un-nesting
	implied by \word[exception]{THROW}).
\end{itemize}

If the input source is a block, these restrictions also apply to
the address returned by \word[core]{SOURCE}. Block buffers are
uniquely assigned to blocks.

\subsection{Parsing} % 7.3.4

The Block word set implements an alternative input source for the
text interpreter. When the input source is a block, \word{BLK} shall
contain the non-zero block number and the input buffer is the
1024-character buffer containing that block.

A block is conventionally displayed as 16 lines of 64 characters.

A program may switch the input source to a block by using
\word{LOAD} or \word{THRU}. Input sources may be nested using
\word{LOAD} and \word{EVALUATE} in any order.

A program may reposition the parse area within a block by
manipulating \word[core]{toIN}. More extensive repositioning can be
accomplished using \word[core]{SAVE-INPUT} and
\word[core]{RESTORE-INPUT}.

See: \xref[3.4.1 Parsing]{usage:parsing}.

\subsection{Possible action on an ambiguous condition} % 7.3.5

See: \xref[3.4.4 Possible action on an ambiguous condition]{usage:ambiguous}.

\begin{itemize}
\item A system with the Block word set may set interpretation state
	and interpret a block.
\end{itemize}

\section{Glossary} % 7.6

\subsection{Block words} % 7.6.1

\begin{worddef}{0790}{BLK}[b-l-k]
\item \stack{}{a-addr}

	\param{a-addr} is the address of a cell containing zero or the
	number of the mass-storage block being interpreted. If
	\word{BLK} contains zero, the input source is not a block and
	can be identified by \word[core]{SOURCE-ID}, if
	\word[core]{SOURCE-ID} is available. An ambiguous condition
	exists if a program directly alters the contents of \word{BLK}.

\see \xref[7.3.3 Block buffer regions]{block:buffers}.
\end{worddef}


\begin{worddef}{0800}{BLOCK}
\item \stack{u}{a-addr}

	\param{a-addr} is the address of the first character of the
	block buffer assigned to mass-storage block \param{u}. An
	ambiguous condition exists if \param{u} is not an available
	block number.

	If block \param{u} is already in a block buffer, \param{a-addr}
	is the address of that block buffer.

	If block \param{u} is not already in memory and there is an
	unassigned block buffer, transfer block \param{u} from mass
	storage to an unassigned block buffer. \param{a-addr} is the
	address of that block buffer.

	If block \param{u} is not already in memory and there are no
	unassigned block buffers, unassign a block buffer. If the block
	in that buffer has been \word{UPDATE}d, transfer the block to
	mass storage and transfer block \param{u} from mass storage into
	that buffer. \param{a-addr} is the address of that block buffer.

	At the conclusion of the operation, the block buffer pointed to
	by \param{a-addr} is the current block buffer and is assigned to
	\param{u}.
\end{worddef}


\begin{worddef}{0820}{BUFFER}
\item \stack{u}{a-addr}

	\param{a-addr} is the address of the first character of the
	block buffer assigned to block \param{u}. The contents of the
	block are unspecified. An ambiguous condition exists if \param{u}
	is not an available block number.

	If block \param{u} is already in a block buffer, \param{a-addr}
	is the address of that block buffer.

	If block \param{u} is not already in memory and there is an
	unassigned 	buffer, \param{a-addr} is the address of that block
	buffer.

	If block \param{u} is not already in memory and there are no
	unassigned block buffers, unassign a block buffer. If the block
	in that buffer has been \word{UPDATE}d, transfer the block to
	mass storage. \param{a-addr} is the address of that block buffer.

	At the conclusion of the operation, the block buffer pointed to
	by \param{a-addr} is the current block buffer and is assigned to
	\param{u}.

\see \wref{block:BLOCK}{BLOCK}.
\end{worddef}


\begin{worddef}{1360}{EVALUATE}
\item Extend the semantics of \wref{core:EVALUATE}{EVALUATE} to
	include: Store zero in \word{BLK}.
\end{worddef}


\begin{worddef}{1559}{FLUSH}
\item \stack{}{}

	Perform the function of \word{SAVE-BUFFERS}, then unassign all
	block buffers.
\end{worddef}


\begin{worddef}{1790}{LOAD}
\item \stack{i*x u}{j*x}

	Save the current input-source specification. Store \param{u} in
	\word{BLK} (thus making block \param{u} the input source and
	setting the input buffer to encompass its contents), set
	\word[core]{toIN} to zero, and interpret. When the parse area is
	exhausted, restore the prior input source specification. Other
	stack effects are due to the words \word{LOAD}ed.

	An ambiguous condition exists if \param{u} is zero or is not a
	valid block number.

\see \xref[3.4 The Forth text interpreter]{usage:command}.
\end{worddef}


\begin{worddef}{2180}{SAVE-BUFFERS}
\item \stack{}{}

	Transfer the contents of each \word{UPDATE}d block buffer to
	mass storage. Mark all buffers as unmodified.
\end{worddef}


\begin{worddef}{2400}{UPDATE}
\item \stack{}{}

	Mark the current block buffer as modified. An ambiguous
	condition exists if there is no current block buffer.

	\word{UPDATE} does not immediately cause I/O.

\see \wref{block:BLOCK}{BLOCK},
	\wref{block:BUFFER}{BUFFER},
	\wref{block:FLUSH}{FLUSH},
	\wref{block:SAVE-BUFFERS}{SAVE-BUFFERS}.
\end{worddef}


\subsection{Block extension words} % 7.6.2
\extended

\begin{worddef}{1330}{EMPTY-BUFFERS}
\item \stack{}{}

	Unassign all block buffers. Do not transfer the contents of
	any \word{UPDATE}d block buffer to mass storage.

\see \wref{block:BLOCK}{BLOCK}.
\end{worddef}


\begin{worddef}{1770}{LIST}
\item \stack{u}{}

	Display block \param{u} in an implementation-defined format.
	Store \param{u} in \word{SCR}.

\see \wref{block:BLOCK}{BLOCK}.
\end{worddef}


\begin{worddef}{2125}{REFILL}
\item \stack{}{flag}

	Extend the execution semantics of \wref{core:REFILL}{REFILL}
	with the following:

	When the input source is a block, make the next block the input
	source and current input buffer by adding one to the value of
	\word{BLK} and setting \word[core]{toIN} to zero. Return
	\emph{true} if the new value of BLK is a valid block number,
	otherwise \emph{false}.

\see \wref{core:REFILL}{REFILL},
	\wref{file:REFILL}{REFILL}.
\end{worddef}


\begin{worddef}{2190}{SCR}[s-c-r]
\item \stack{}{a-addr}

	\param{a-addr} is the address of a cell containing the block
	number of the block most recently \word{LIST}ed.

	\begin{rationale} % A.7.6.2.2190 SCR
		\word{SCR} is short for screen.
	\end{rationale}
\end{worddef}


\begin{worddef}{2280}{THRU}
\item \stack{i*x u_1 u_2}{j*x}

	\word{LOAD} the mass storage blocks numbered \param{u_1} through
	\param{u_2} in sequence. Other stack effects are due to the words
	\word{LOAD}ed.
\end{worddef}


\begin{worddef}[bs]{2535}{\bs}[backslash]
\item Extend the semantics of \wref{core:bs}{\bs} to be:

\compile
	Perform the execution semantics given below.

\execute
	\stack{"ccc<eol>"}{}

	If \word{BLK} contains zero, parse and discard the remainder
	of the parse area; otherwise parse and discard the portion
	of the parse area corresponding to the remainder of the current
	line. \word{bs} is an immediate word.
\end{worddef}
